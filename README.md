# Zenith-Hiring-Platform-ViteJS

To run the project:
- npm install
- npm run dev



This is the frontend for Hiring platform and there are 3 main webpages in this project
- Homepage
- Signin and Signup page
- Search-Candidate by Location / job-role page.
I have used sample_data.js to show the functionality for search-candidate page, this file can be modified for functionality.
